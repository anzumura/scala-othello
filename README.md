# Scala Othello

I created this project in 2012 to learn Scala and IntelliJ IDE. It's based on
an Othello game I wrote in 'C' in the early 90's. I eventually started using
Scala professionally in late 2014 including using *Gradle*, lots  of automated
testing (*ScalaTest* and *Cucumber*), *Ansible*, *Jenkins*, etc..

At some point I plan to come back to this code and upgrade it to have automated
testing, maybe try *SBT*, port to Scala 3 and use more Scala idiomatic code based
on what I've learned.
