# Scala Othello

History:

- Early 2012: created this project to learn Scala and IntelliJ IDE (it's based
  on an Othello game I wrote in 'C' in the early 90's)
- Late 2014: starting using Scala professionally on large projects using
  *Scalactic*, *ScalaTest*, *Gradle*, *Ansible*, etc. (and learned a lot!)
- May 2021: added project to *GitHub* and migrated to build with Scala 2.13
- July 2023: migrated to Scala 3.3.0. This only required a few small changes
  related to 'do-while' loops and 'non-local returns'. I also removed
  braces and now rely on indentation instead (a very nice Scala 3 feature).
- Aug 2023: use *SBT* for building and start using *ScalaTest*. I will now try
  to re-write the code in a more functional way (adding tests along the way).
