# Scala Othello

I created this project in 2012 to learn Scala and IntelliJ IDE. It's based on
an Othello game I wrote in 'C' in the early 90's. I started using Scala
professionally in 2014 (along with *Gradle*, *ScalaTest*, *Cucumber*,
*Ansible*, *Jenkins*, etc.)

At some point I plan to add automated testing, maybe try *SBT* and use more
Scala idiomatic code based on what I've learned.
